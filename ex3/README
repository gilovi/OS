FILES:
blockchain.cpp/h	implementation library.
block.cpp/h		represents a block in chain
general.h		macros
Makefile		the makefile for the exercise.
README			this file.

REMARKS:
We have chosen to implement the library by implementing a single daemon thread,
that its sole responsibility is to take the next block that is to be attached
to the chain (if there are any), and calculate its hash (by calling the hash
function).
For every data-structure used by the library (maps, lists, vectors), we lock 
its access by respective mutex variables.
In order to avoid the daemon function to do "busy waiting", we use
a conditional variable that is accessed by the "add_block()" function, when 
a block is added. Therefore, the daemon function is "awake" only when
the queue of blocks that are to be added (their hash was not calculated) is non-empty.

ANSWERS:
1. The fact that the library is non-blocking (by using a daemon thread) allows a block
to have multiple blocks pointing to it. The amount of time that the OS allocates for the 
deamon thread to run, affects the number of multi-pointer blocks. We cannot change it.
2. approach for one long chain.
3. race conditions not dealt with.
