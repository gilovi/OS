 * has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data
 * and return any errors.  Since many applications ignore close()
 * errors this is not always useful.
 *
 * NOTE: The flush() method may be called more than once for each
 * open().  This happens if more than one file descriptor refers
 * to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls.  It is
 * not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush
 * should be treated equally.  Multiple write-flush sequences are
 * relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.

 * Filesystems shouldn't assume that flush will always be called
 * after some writes, or that if will be called at all.

 * with the same flags and file descriptor.  It is possible to
